Session Type: 60-Minute Session

Intro to GitHub for (Non-Coding) Cultural Heritage Professionals by (Non-Coding) Photographers

Abstract description: The code repository GitHub is a great place to find projects shared by your colleagues and is also a way for groups to work together asynchronously. It is a community and technology built on top of a particular distributed version control method, named git. GitHub is not just for code - it can be used for documents, metadata, and spreadsheets; you can even host a static website in a GitHub repository! In this introductory session, Jeremy and Charles will walk through the GitHub process for two projects: a text-based studio workflow document and some custom Python scripts to expand the capabilities of the imaging software Capture One Pro.

Proposed session format: (e.g. round-table discussion, multi-presenter panel, single presenter case study, etc.) Zoom / Hangouts / GoToMeeting with two presenters and a moderator

Key learning outcomes: “After attending, participants will be able to…” After attending, participants will be able to browse GitHub for code or documentation that's relevant to their cultural heritage work. They'll have an overview of how to search, download, and modify code or documentation from GitHub, and how to share improvements they've made.

How does this session contribute to the conference theme, MCN, and the museum sector: (200 words max) Jeremy and Charles are always working to expand the collective knowledge of cultural heritage photographers. Projects like Jeremy's Coding for Cultural Heritage (it's coding4ch on GitHub) are resources for photographers, but GitHub can have a steep learning curve. We want to give photographers and other non-coding cultural heritage professionals a start in using GitHub for their own projects, and let them know how they can share their code customizations with others. This session would fit into MCN's conference Strand 2 or 3, as 'integrating new tools...to promote adoption and success' and 'writing and testing open-source code for the collective benefit of organizations.'
